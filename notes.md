## Design
- consider web-first design for the hackathon project since I assume most people will be on web
- what kind of video format or animations fit web better? wide screen
- what kinds of design are used in LoL? emphasis on art, cohesive aesthetics, lore, fantasy
- visual effects
- sound design: gameplay cues, feedback (good or bad), driving emotion
- user interface; visual design principles: present complex info in a simple, intuitive way.
    - audience: what kinds of things do they connect with? (fav champ)

## page design
1. "REWIND" text; maybe LoL client blue background with magic
    - "rewind" disruptive visual effect
    - soundscape: tape reverse sound effect; maybe with splices of Arcane soundtrack and other LoL sounds
        - https://freesound.org/people/cribbler/sounds/511454/ cut into beginning and looping middle section
    - EKKO ULT??? EKKO SOUND EFFECTS???? YO?? EKKO WATCH TICKING?
    - clicking will pause the animations and zoom into the rewind
    - mute button on page
2. Enter Riot ID as input -> waiting screen while data is loading
